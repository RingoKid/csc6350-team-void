# Implementation Status

## Implemented Features

1. **Project Presentation & Management**
   - The frontend includes a `SinglePageView.vue` component that displays project details such as title, description, and a preview section. However, the preview section currently shows "none", indicating that the actual project presentation (PDF, PPT, videos) might not be fully integrated yet.

2. **Feedback & Rating System**
   - The `SinglePageView.vue` component also includes a feedback system where users can add comments and rate projects. This feature is implemented with a comment section that allows users to input comments and select a rating from 1 to 5 stars.

3. **User Interaction & Collaboration**
   - The application includes user authentication features with login and dashboard components (`Login.vue` and `Dashboard.vue`). The `Login.vue` component handles user login and token storage, while the `Dashboard.vue` component provides a simple interface for logged-in users.
   - The `Navbar.vue` component provides navigation links to different parts of the application, including home, project, blog, dashboard, and login pages.

## Missing or Incomplete Features

1. **Project Presentation & Management**
   - The actual functionality for uploading and organizing academic presentations (PDF, PPT, embedded videos) is not evident in the current codebase. This feature might require additional backend support and integration with the frontend.

2. **Feedback & Rating System**
   - While the basic comment and rating system is implemented, there is no evidence of a leaderboard or a system to highlight top-rated projects. This feature might require additional backend logic and frontend components.

3. **User Interaction & Collaboration**
   - The current implementation does not show any specific features for user profiles displaying academic backgrounds or facilitating networking between students and faculty members. These features might require additional components and backend support.
